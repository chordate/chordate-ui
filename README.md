###What

An Application Health Suite (throughput, exceptions, logging)

###Why

The current offerings are pretty poor and mostly offer one facet of what is needed
to understand the current state of your application. You need to know when the site slows down,
but you also need to correlate a cause. Using two services to answer this question has a
significant latency.
